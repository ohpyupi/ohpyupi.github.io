# tl;dr

1. It was a bit challenging to become a software engineer without regular CS background 
2. However, it is definitely possible to be a self-taught software engineer
3. Enjoy endless study on programming/engineering/CS fundamentals
4. No need of spending on expensive boot camps. Use Google, YouTube, Leetcode, and Internet!
5. Don’t give up

# 1. My first footstep in programming

My first experience on programming was not my intention at all. When I was a senior college student, I met a junior student in the department. We both studied physics. I was so certain that he was absolutely brilliant student, but I noticed that he does not put much efforts in studying in classes. And I found that he is doing some programming stuffs.

He talked about learning Python and what he has been doing with Python. He basically was working on building a cluster with multiple CPUs and implementing parallel programming. That time I had no idea what he was talking about. Seriously that time, I gave him an advice not to waste his time, but study physics harder cause it will be going tougher in the senior year. But as you can tell, he didn’t listen to me.

Later on, when I graduated, I already got an admission from a graduate school in Ohio for my master’s degree. And I noticed that my collegemate is going to be an instructor in a coding boot camp. That made me really surprised and I noticed that he is really serious about this. And he was recruiting his students for the upcoming summer. That time, my curiosity grew up, and I asked him to put me in his class. I am not certain if he was happy or not about that. But I took part in his coding class.

When it started, they taught me HTML, CSS, and some sever development using Python. What I remember there was I made my resume with those programming stuff. But since I had to go to the states for my study, I could not finish his course, but left the course two weeks after joining it. But it was pretty interesting time. While being a physics student, I always used just paper and pencils to find solutions for problems. And that was it. But with programming, I could go more. Find a solution, and build something on top of the solution that I found.

# 2. How my programming journey really started

I got a couple of admissions from graduate schools in the states. So one was an admission for PhD study, but another one was for Master’s study. That time, I was not certain if I really wanted to go with the PhD route. Being called “Dr. Lee” seemed to be attractive, but I was not really sure on myself if I have really much passion to study until my mid or end of 30s to just get the title of PhD.

Anyway, I earned teaching assistantship for both admissions. So the tuition and the living cost was all covered up, so the money was not an issue that time. Hence, I chose the admission with the master’s study. I thought that it will have given me better decision later time.

When I started my master’s study at Miami University, I wanted to study on the theoretical aspect of quantum mechanics. And organically, I got into programming there. I noticed that Python is a primary language in the academia. Since I learned Python a little bit in the past summer, I was able to relatively quickly ramp up myself for writing simulation script using Python.

It was freaking fun. So basically, in the physics research, there are two big components, theoretical research and experimental research. Those two mainly studies and researches on the same things, but the approach on their study is different. For experimentalists, they build up machines or devices and prove their idea by running those physical devices. And for theorists, they use sometimes papers and pens, but mostly use programming to run simulation and validate if their assumptions or idea are correct by checking the results of the simulation. And there comes the collaboration. Let say, theorists run simulation and get the number and share it with experimentalists. If the experimentalists get the number in the similar range from their devices, both parties can confirm together their approach is definitely right.

So my master’s thesis subject became writing a simulation with graphical interface for a certain quantum system. And it could be potentially used by other experimental research group in the department. That time, I didn’t know what is Class, object-oriented programming, scope, and anything. I just tried everything I could do, watching Google, YouTube, and any source that seems helpful (definitely Stackoverflow).

As the research goes on, my passion grew more on programming. I loved the idea that what I make is working and can be used by others! And I decided to look for programming career. It wasn’t easy at all. I didn’t take any regular curriculum for computer science or programming, but self-taught myself to be able to write simulation for my master’s thesis. But I didn’t give up. I made a resume, and submitted it to all job search portals. Didn’t get any response from any of them.

But I didn’t give up. So I also checked in to Craigslist, and tried to find a job posting for programmers. I found several of them and applied to those jobs. Finally, I was able to get a response from one of them.

# 3. First programming job

I was so desperate to become a programmer that time and finally got one call back from a company in Blue Ash in Ohio. It was a very small startup company. When I first visited the office, I think there were only three or four people. I think majority of people were C of something or head of something. In the interview, they asked me the salary range, and I said they don’t need to pay me at all, and all I want is just to work here and build experience.

I was able to start my internship there without any compensation except the monthly parking fee reimbursement. But I was so happy that I could work as a programmer.

My responsibility there was to build websites for customers using Wordpress. Looking back, it was the worst thing that programmers could do. Making websites using Wordpress was really terrible experience. One thing that I could learn there was CSS. Other than that, I didn’t need any programming language there, but just installing some modules and just clicking some buttons to build websites. That was it. And sometimes I also had to visit customers and consult them. Again, it was really terrible experience. But there was no choice to me at all.

All I could to was to keep working there and on my spare time I kept teaching myself modern programming languages, and other engineering skills.

# 4. Strategy to become a competitive engineer

Even if I really appreciated the fact that I could work as a programmer in the company, I felt that this is not really what I wanted. I wanted to solve more technically challenging problems, not just making websites with some tools.

So I researched on what are the modern technologies being used out there. That time, JavaScript was getting attention and being in a spot. Google created V8 engine that boosted JavaScript performance in browser significantly. In the past, JavaScript had been just known for scripting language in web browser. However, NodeJS utilized the V8 engine, and it enabled JavaScript to be used for backend and low-level programming.

So I started learning NodeJS and modern JavaScript front-end frameworks Angular and React. Of course, I could not use it in my work because I didn’t need them at all for developing Wordpress websites. However, I kept learning them. But how? I just randomly searched around sample codes for Angular, React, and NodeJS. And I tried to make web applications out of them. That time, since I didn’t really have a solid background in programming, it was like more of putting puzzles together. In the end, I was able to make a simple web application for e-commerce and it contained simple authentication flows.

And surprisingly, there was some changes in the work place. The CEO wanted to change the business direction so that the company not only builds Wordpress website, but also creates prototype web application for other startup companies. So they hired a senior engineer who has an extensive experience in the software engineering. And luckily, I was selected to be part of that new business.

And that was the real beginning of my career path as a software engineer. And also, the senior engineer picked AWS as our main cloud computing platform. And it organically made me exposed to the cloud computing as well. And I made a plan to get a certificate for AWS.

As a result, I took part in three web application development projects for local startup companies and also earned an AWS certificate that made my profile somewhat competitive than previously.

# 5. Fly to California

Once I got some experience in web application development and got the AWS certificate, I started looking for new job opportunities. And definitely I wanted to go big world either California or Eastern Cost. I created a resume and submitted it to all different companies in the states.

I think I applied to more than 100 companies, but in the end, I made it to onsite interviews for only three companies.

The reason why the rate was so low was not only the less years of experience, but also lack of the data structure and algorithm skills. That time, I didn’t know what is data structure and algorithm at all. I just focused on the practical skills such as learning new JavaScript frameworks and cloud computing. And I didn’t really know about CS fundamentals.

But anyway luckily I was able to make it to onsite interviews, and got an acceptance from a company in California. The benefit was awesome after taking the offer. They provided the moving support from Ohio to California. For example, they paid my first month rent, shipping fee for my cars, and also furniture that we bought after moving to California.

# 6. Realizing the need of fundamentals

One thing that I noticed after coming to California is that there were a ton of smart engineers in the company and also a lot of opportunities to meet brilliant people. When I worked at a small startup company in Ohio, we all tried out best to grow and deliver results at their most. However, most of us were juniors and at the early time of their career path. So there was some struggle there definitely.

However, when I joined the company in California there were engineers who have experience with more than 10 years and also I had a chance to work with product managers, QA engineers, and also sometimes sales people. It seemed like by just joining meetings and talking to some people, I felt like I learned a lot.

Also, what I noticed after moving to California was that I got a ton of messages from recruiters in LinkedIn. It seemed like there is a whole new different world here where engineers are very well treated. So within a few months after coming to California, I got contacted by FAANG recruiters and invited to their campus for interviews.

The result was not good. It was simply because I did not know anything about data structure and algorithm. The interview question that I got there was simple sorting problem. But, again I didn’t know anything about it. So after getting a quick rejection, I started thinking about the importance of learning CS fundamentals.

# 7. Better opportunities after learning fundamentals

So after feeling the need of CS fundamentals, I started learning it. At the beginning, I seriously doubted about why I really need to learn about it. It seemed like knowing hooks, Redux, or GraphQL seemed to be more valuable and powerful at the work place. That is still true, but I kept learning the fundamentals. Below are the list of the fundamentals I studied.

- Time/Space Complexity
- Data structure 
  - Array
  - Linked List
  - Stack/Queue
  - Heap
  - Trie
  - Tree
  - Graph
  - Hash Table
- Algorithms
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Greedy algorithm
  - Divide-and-conquer
  - Graph Traversal
  - Two Pointers
  - Sorting and Searching
  - Sliding Window

So I picked one book to study the high-level concepts of these. And I used Leetcode website to keep practicing solving problems from those topics. Some people still question about the necessity of studying those fundamentals, but it will definitely help one to crack coding interview, and also in my opinion that helped my daily coding as well. By knowing time/space complexity, I could know the high level performance of my code, and also knowing data structure I could think about same problem in different aspects applying different data structure.

Anyway, it really helped my interview skills, and was able to move to globally known companies in the Bay Area.

# 8. Final thoughts

I never regret my decision to become a software engineer. It was harsh at the beginning. I had felt that my entire time to study physics became useless, and sometimes I was very scared, thinking about not achieving anything after the decision.

However, because of that bold decision, I went through a lot of challenges, and I grew up a lot from solving those challenges one by one. And also, I felt that the study of physics actually helped me when it comes to problem solving, analytical thinking, an also when studying CS fundamentals as well. I think the transition from physics to software engineering was not that bad idea, but a good option for physicists can take. And also, I believe that other people from different background can also do that. Even if the subject differs, in the end we all study how to solve problems in the world in college or graduate schools. I am a strong believer that engineers with different background can bring values to the table for engineering teams.

And since I went through a self-taught software engineer route, I get questions from people who also wants to shift from their original career to software engineers. They usually think about going into a coding boot camp. But I hardly think that is a best option. Nowadays, not only the programming but also a lot of things, such as diet plan or fitness, are already shared in YouTube, Google, or in Internet. Joining a coding boot camp will help to become an engineer. But I am not sure if that is really valuable given the expensive tuition. I would rather encourage people to study the coding by themselves, and build the working experience as soon as possible.

Sure, if you want to join FAANG company right away after studying coding for a few months, you probably would want to take the boot camp. However, you notice that FAANG is not the only place where engineers can grow. Especially, I started my first job in a very small company. It became actually a very good experience and a very good story in my entire life as an engineer.

No matter what path you take, the whole journey to become an engineer will be an interesting journey. Of course, it can be sometimes challenging. However, don’t give up. It is definitely worth to do it!
