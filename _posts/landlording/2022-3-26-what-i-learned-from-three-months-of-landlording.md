# tl;dr

1. When a lease expires, the lease converts to a month-to-month agreement under certain conditions[1].
2. For a month-to-month agreement, both tenants and landlords must give termination notices to the other party within a “reasonable” timeframe through “written” notice[1].
3. Failure of paying rent can cause tenants to be evicted.
4. If a tenant is evicted, the eviction record will be shown in a credit report for a long time.

# First-time Landlording

I purchased a rental property in 2021 December. Since my wife and I were looking for a rental property and the seller wanted to stay in the property after the sale, we provided a rent-back option in our offer. That worked for both parties, and I was so excited with my first rental property purchase and landlording immediately after purchase.

# Murphy’s law; anything can go wrong will eventually go wrong

It seems like there is no landlord who had no issue with their tenants. Just like any other landlord, I got an issue as well. And I didn’t expect to have an issue this early. The tenant, the former seller, had some issues with their new house, and they wanted to stay beyond the rent-back term. Our rent-back term ends on March 7th, but their request was to stay for the full month of March. That seemed pretty acceptable and we really felt sorry for the tenant for what they are going through. Hence, we agreed upon the rent term extension.

The extension part was actually pretty easy. In California, a lease contract gets converted to a month-to-month rental agreement automatically under certain conditions. The conditions are the followings: “landlord receives the next month's rent“, “tenant remains in the property after the term”, etc. More details can be found in Civil Code Section 1946.1.

But at the same time, my wife and I really wanted to find a new tenant who will stay in our property long-term. Hence, while extending the term a bit, we wanted to draw a clear line that further stay won’t be welcomed. So we started drafting a new lease agreement.

In the new lease agreement, we updated the rent fee. Since the rent was given through the rent-back option, we provided lower-market value for the rent fee. And each month we’re losing about $200 dollars. So in the new agreement, we put the market-value rent price.

After sharing it with the tenant, I instantly felt that their response is getting delayed, which was a kind of red-ish signal. On the third week of March, they sent us a text message they decided to leave at the end of March. I was very surprised not only because of the 1-week notice but their naive announcement. California is known for being friendly to tenants over landlords. However, still landlords have the rights to be protected by state laws. And, the law clearly says that tenants should give 30 days of notice to terminate their tenancy and the notice must be given as written notice. And obviously, SMS messages or emails cannot be considered as written notice.

# Think about Worst Scenario
As soon as things were heading south, I tried to imagine the worst scenario and see what would be the impact on me. The facts were below.

1. Our agreement is a month-to-month rental agreement.
2. They didn’t give us a written notice for the termination of tenancy.

With that, the worst scenario was in favor of me. If I keep being silent until it passes by April 1st which is the due date of rent, I can start the eviction process. And since clearly, tenants violated the term, eviction will be approved by a jury. And as a result, the tenants will be evicted and the eviction record will be shown on their credit record for a long time.

However, even if the worst scenario is in favor of me, there were still hurdles on me: (1) I have to hire an attorney, (2) the eviction process can delay the process to have long-term tenant, and (3) always there are odds in the court. Hence, instead of the worst scenario, I prepared other options and got on the call with the tenant to make a deal.

# Resolution

With the decision not to go with the worst scenario approach, my wife and I prepared deals that can resolve the issue.

1. Offer the tenants a prorated rent option, but with a specified move-out date.
2. Tenants leave on March 31st, but compensate us for the financial loss which is less than half the updated rent fee.

Landlords do not need to pay back the prorated rent fee for days the tenant didn’t stay in the property. As long as the rent starts, no matter tenants leave early, normally the tenants should pay for the full month. However, we still wanted to make an offer that seems attractive to tenants, but mitigate our financial loss as much as possible. Hence, the first option provided a prorated rent option, but we still wanted to have clarity on the move-out date. That way, we can plan forward the process to find prospective tenants.

For the second option, tenants were given an opportunity to leave on the date, March 31st, they decided. However, still, since they violated the term, we had the right to claim expenses to look out prospective tenants from them by the law. Hence, we suggested getting some compensation to reduce our financial loss as much as possible and let them go peacefully.

After the phone call discussion with tenants, we’ve agreed upon the first option. I think tenants were reluctant to pay for the full rental fee but still wanted to stay in the property until their new house issue is gone. So the tenants will stay until April 15th and pay half of the updated rent price. Right after the call, I revised the new lease agreement and sent it out to them. And finally, we’re on the new lease contract.

# So Far So Good Learning

I am glad that the situation got resolved for now. However, for a few days, I was quite stressed out thinking about what-if questions. But this also gave me good opportunities to re-read the lease agreement we created when we were buying the property and was able to go through each clause in the contract.  And with that learning, I also created my first legal document and get it signed. Also, now I studied one of the worst scenarios I can potentially face in the future, and this will be really good learning as well.
