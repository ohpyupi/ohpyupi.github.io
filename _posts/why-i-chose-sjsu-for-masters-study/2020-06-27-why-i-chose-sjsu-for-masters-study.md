# Motivation
I am a self-taught programmer who does not have a CS background. Many non-CS students go
through the coding bootcamp to study the programming, but I didn't know about it at all
during that time.

My study resource was only Google and Youtube. Luckily, those were quite effective and
I was able to become a software engineer. However, always I felt that I lack some fundamentals.
Hence, when I had a one-on-one with my manager, I shared my thoughts about the master's study in
software engineering. Thankfully, the manager was very supportive to my education. And that
was the beginning of my master's study journey.

# School Selections
The schools that made to my final list were [Georgia Tech OMSCS][omscs] and [SJSU][sjsu].
There were various reasons. However, one of the reasons to pick them up was the education cost.
OMSCS's total tuition was roughly $7,000. It was very cheap compared to other schools.
And for SJSU, the total cost was about $25,000.
It was relatively more expensive than the cost of OMSCS. However, my final choice was SJSU.
I will go over the reasons why I chose SJSU.

## Why SJSU?
### 1. Program designed for full-time workers
SJSU now has [Engineering Extended Studies][sjsu-ees] department that provides programs for
full-time workers.
One concern when I was looking for master's program was that the program schedule was designed
for students, not for full-time workers. However, the programs served in the EES department was 
designed for the full-time workers.

For example, in traditional academic programs, students take multiple courses per semester.
However, the program in EES was not based on semesters, but organized courses in a way that
students will take only one course at a time. In total, the program will take about 2 years
and a couple months to graduate. However, this setup looked perfect for full-time workers
taking the master's program on top of their full-time work.

In addition to that, all courses were held either in week days evening or Saturdays. To give
mode details, if I take a course, the course will be 8 weeks long and every Wednesday evening
I took a class. And there was one 6 hours long Saturday class. Of course, 6 hours long class
was sometimes challenging. However, this was a lot better than having classes in day times
that will conflict with my work times.

### 2. On-site learning program
When I was starting the study at SJSU, it was before COVID19. And I was not really familiar with
remote work and studies. Even if my company encourages the remote work, I didn't really like it.

Hence, that time I also looked for a master's program that will be held on campus. Hence, during
the classes I was able to meet classmates and professors in person.

Eventually, because of the COVID, the program turned into the remote study. However, the transition
from the on-site to the remote study was very smooth. And, it gave me an opportunity to get used
to the remote study. And I am now a big fan of both remote study and work!


### 3. Research opportunity
The program consists of 8 courses and 2 courses for master's thesis. When I checked the OMSCS,
it didn't really have the research track. I think some says still the OMSCS students can take
the research track, but it seemed a bit difficult to do so.

However, by default, SJSU EES programs were set up for students to do research at the end of
the program. Currently, I made a team with my classmates and work on the master's thesis.
What I like about the thesis is that I can work on a very practical subject and also that
can be extended to producing a paper. I am very satisfied with the master's thesis option
provided the SJSU EES program.

### 4. Cybersecurity focus
At the time of applying to the master's program at SJSU, I worked in a team for user authentication.
And working in the team, I grew interests in the cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is such a broad
subject and it was pretty difficult to learn it by myself. 

But luckily, the SJSU EES provided a master's program with the focus of Cybersecurity. Click
[here][sjsu-cybersecurity] to visit its website. It seemed perfectly aligned with my interest
and it became one of the reasons to choose SJSU for my master's degree.

Now, I know the fundamental ideas of network protocols, cryptography, and secure software
engineering. The course that taught me those subjects were definitely worth to take. And
I use those knowledges for my daily development, which is really nice.

# Conclusions
Now, I completed all 8 courses and I am taking a course for formulating my research idea and
providing a project workbook. I am really excited about working on the master's research and project.
And I don't reget my decision on choosing SJSU for my master's degree.

And each course's outcome was focused on the practical goals. For example, each course required
students to form a team and to deliver a hands-on project. Hence, my team created a prototype of using 
machine learning for HTTP requests. And we also had an opportunity to present the idea and 
the prototype in a Meetup's meeting.

If you are interested in pursuing the master's program in SJSU ESS, feel free to email me.
